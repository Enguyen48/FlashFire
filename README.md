## Project Overview

Senior undergraduates in the [Engineering Physics program](https://uca.edu/physics/engineering-physics/) at the University of Central Arkansas complete a two-semester Senior Design project before graduation. The 2022-2023 senior team designed an small autonomous vehicle to compete in two robotics competitions: (1) the Autonomous Vehicle Challenge at the 2023 [National Robotics Challenge](https://www.thenrc.org/) (NRC) in Marion, Ohio and (2) the Intelligent Vehicle Challenge at the 2023 [Arkansas Space Grant Consortium](https://arkansasspacegrant.org/) (ASGC) Symposium in Morrilton, Arkansas. To earn points in both competitions, the robot needed to autonomously navigate through an obstacle course in under five minutes by driving around five multi-colored buckets, driving under a small arch, and driving over a ramp. An image of the course layout provided by NRC 2023 contest manual is shown above.

## Competition Rules
- Maximum vehicle size: 24" x 24" x 24"
- Vehicle must be fully autonomous and self-contained
- Everything necessary for the vehicle naviguation, processing, sensing must be attached
- No transmission or communication is allowed, except GPS
- No tether to a laptop or a device is allowed
- Vehicle must be started with a physical button, not a wireless communication
- The event runs regardless of the weather
- Points are earned for clearing each obstacle and crossing the finish line
